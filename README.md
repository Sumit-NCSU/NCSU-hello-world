# hello-world
GitHub Steps:

To create a new repository

    In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select New repository.
    Name your repository hello-world.
    Write a short description.
    Select Initialize this repository with a README.

To create a new branch

    Go to your new repository hello-world.
    Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
    Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
    Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Make and commit changes

    Click the README.md file.
    Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
    In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
    Write a commit message that describes your changes.
    Click Commit changes button.

Open a Pull Request for changes to the README

    Click on the image for a larger version
    Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
    Select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).
    Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
    When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
    Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

Merge your Pull Request

In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.

    Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
    Click Confirm merge.
    Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.

Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

    Created an open source repository
    Started and managed a new branch
    Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub

Take a look at your GitHub profile and you’ll see your new contribution squares!
